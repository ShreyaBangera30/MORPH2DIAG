# fMRI-Phenotyping-Classification

## Key Features
1. Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for fMRI-based phenotyping and classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) cohorts, leveraging structural biomarkers such as hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning.
2. Preprocessed longitudinal fMRI datasets to extract high-resolution morphometric features from anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs), emphasizing structural correlates of AD pathology.
3. Designed and rigorously benchmarked supervised classification architectures—recurrent neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests, to quantify diagnostic discriminability across clinical cohorts.
4. Conducted voxel-wise and ROI-based analyses to identify imaging biomarkers predictive of cognitive decline, correlating model-derived representations with clinical diagnoses and neuropsychological assessments to strengthen biological interpretability and translational relevance.
